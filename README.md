# Michael Huang's Research on Witsenhausen's problem

This github repo will be showing my work on Witsenhausen's problem, which looks to find the maximum area of the largest non-orthogonal set on a unit sphere. For my project, I will be working specifically on the 3-dimensional case. My methodology uses a probablistic method. I essentially rotate a set of vectors around and calculate the largest maximum independent vertex set among this set of vectors.
